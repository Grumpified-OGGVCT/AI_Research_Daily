### 1. POPE: Learning to Reason on Hard Problems via Privileged On-Policy Exploration

**Authors**: Yuxiao Qu et al.  
**Research Score**: 0.89 (Highly Significant)  
**Source**: arxiv  

**Core Contribution**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet state-of-the-art methods still fail to learn on many training problems. On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for ...

**Why This Matters**: This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in the field. The approach represents a meaningful advance that will likely influence future research directions.

**Context**: This work builds on recent developments in [related area] and opens new possibilities for [application domain].

**Limitations**: As with any research, there are caveats. [Watch for replication studies and broader evaluation.]

**Authors**: Mehmet Velioglu et al.  
**Research Score**: 0.83 (Highly Significant)  
**Source**: arxiv  

**Core Contribution**: Separating liquid-liquid dispersions in gravity settlers is critical in chemical, pharmaceutical, and recycling processes. The dense-packed zone height is an important performance and safety indicator but it is often expensive and impractical to measure due to optical limitations. We propose to esti...
