## Copyright Compliance and Content Moderation Strategy

### Copyright Compliance
To ensure adherence to copyright laws and ethical standards, the following guidelines must be followed:

1. **Use of Third-Party Content**: Only use content that is properly licensed for reuse. This includes Creative Commons licenses, public domain materials, or content with explicit permissions for use.
2. **Attribution**: Always provide clear and accurate attribution for third-party content, including the creator's name, source, and license details.
3. **Fair Use Policies**: Ensure that the use of copyrighted material falls under fair use provisions, such as for commentary, criticism, or educational purposes. Avoid using substantial portions of copyrighted works without permission.

### Content Moderation Strategy
To maintain a respectful and inclusive environment, the following content moderation strategy will be implemented:

1. **Criteria for Offensive Material**: Offensive material includes, but is not limited to, hate speech, explicit content, harassment, and any material that promotes violence or discrimination.
2. **Moderation Workflow**:
   - **Content Review**: All submissions will undergo a review process by designated moderators.
   - **Flagging System**: Users can flag content they find inappropriate for moderator review.
   - **Escalation**: Content flagged multiple times or deemed highly offensive will be escalated to senior moderators for immediate action.
3. **Reporting Mechanisms**: Provide users with an easy-to-use reporting tool to report offensive material. Ensure anonymity and confidentiality for reporters.
